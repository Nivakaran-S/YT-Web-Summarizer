# 🦜 LangChain YouTube & Website Summarizer  

**AI-powered summarization tool** that transforms **YouTube videos** and **web articles** into concise, 300-word summaries in seconds — powered by **Groq’s ultra-fast LLMs** and **LangChain**.  

This project showcases my ability to **integrate cutting-edge AI models**, **build end-to-end data pipelines**, and design **clean, interactive user experiences** for real-world applications.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out  

- **Practical AI Application** – Not just a demo; this tool solves a real productivity problem for researchers, students, and professionals.  
- **Multi-Source Intelligence** – Works seamlessly with both **YouTube transcripts** and **web article text**.  
- **Optimized Summarization Pipeline** – Combines **prompt engineering** with LangChain’s summarization chains for clarity, accuracy, and brevity.  
- **High-Performance LLM Inference** – Uses **Groq’s Gemma-7B-It** model for lightning-fast responses.  
- **Polished User Experience** – Built with **Streamlit**, ensuring recruiters see a functional, visually clean app.
